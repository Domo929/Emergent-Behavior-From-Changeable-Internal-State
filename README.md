# Emergent Behavior From Internal States

## Dominic Cupo, Joshua Bloom

### Todo
* Experiment Analysis
  1. Fix Group Rotation to match Brown's implementation 
  2. Add Angular Momentum 
  3. Centroid calculation
  4. Calculate 5 spacial measurements but for members of each state
     * This gives us 3 values per spatial measurement: total swarm, swarm state 0, swarm state 1
 
* General fixes
  1. Make sure to update names and outputs when the analysis stuff is added
  
* Final Analysis 
  1. Implement Bootstrapping
  2. Improved data visualization
